It's just a cigarette, and it cannot be that bad
Honey, don't you love me and you know it makes me sad?
It's just a cigarette like you always used to do
I was different then, I don't need them to be cool
It's just a cigarette, and it harms your pretty lungs
Well, it's only twice a week, so there's not much of a chance
It's just a cigarette; it'll soon be only ten
Honey, can you trust me?, when I want to stop I can
It's just a cigarette, and it's just a Marlboro Light
Maybe, but is it worth it if we fight?
